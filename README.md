## cow-gen!

### details
---
this project uses a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate cow patterns.

unfortunately, i can't find a large dataset of cow faces $+$ the quality isn't that great, so ive decided to just generating unique cow patterns. if anyone has a dataset of cow images $\geq 500$ images, i would appreciate it a lot, if you'd let me use it <3.

note that:

* ive just downloaded a lot of images of google. so i have no info about the source of these images. i have <b>no rights</b> over the images in the dataset.
* dataset is really unorganized/small, since i scraped it myself
* the code was repurposed from keras's code examples. (code will look pretty similar)

### generation
---

here are some generated cow patterns if you came here for that:

![pattern1](examples/cow_pictures/pattern1.png) ![pattern2](examples/cow_pictures/pattern2.png) ![pattern3](examples/cow_pictures/pattern3.png) ![pattern4](examples/cow_pictures/pattern4.png) ![pattern5](examples/cow_pictures/pattern5.png) ![pattern7](examples/cow_pictures/pattern7.png) ![pattern8](examples/cow_pictures/pattern8.png) ![pattern9](examples/cow_pictures/pattern9.png) ![pattern10](examples/cow_pictures/pattern10.png) ![pattern11](examples/cow_pictures/pattern11.png)

### use
---

note that epochs take a long time to generate, so you probably don't want to run it for that long.

for me, it took ~$195$ minutes to run $100$ epochs.

but, if you still want to see it ~~to spite me~~, clone this github repo, and run the jupyter notebook, with however many epochs you want!
